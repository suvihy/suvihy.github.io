          <p>Generally in Nordic welfare countries life expectancy is higher than ever and mortality rates
              have decreased, but differences can be seen when comparing Nordic welfare countries to each other.

              referring to Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. </p>
              <p>By concentrating on the aging population and comparing selected indicators related to population,

          <p>It is not a news that the population structure in Nordic welfare countries has been changing during the past
            decades - population pyramids resemble more pillar shapes than pyramids. 
          </p>
          <p> The proportion of elderly people of the total population has been increasing for some time. 
              Meanwhile the proportion of young people and those in the working-age population has either remained
              constant or decreased. Behind lies reasons like decreasing fertility rates, improving health in general 
              and steadily increasing life expectancy.

        the portion of young age groups are smaller than in the other sompared countries. </p>

        <p>Chronic disease, frailty, and disability tend to become more prevalent at older ages,
            but a population with a higher life expectancy doesn't automatically mean a healthier population 
            or other way around. It is important to understand whether increased longevity is accompanied
            by more or fewer years with good health and to track changes in the health status of
            the population over time.
        </p>
        <p>In this section health status of population aged 65 and over is inspected with indicators such as
          life expectancy and healthy life years in the age of 65, self-perceived health and causes of death.
        </p>

              <h3>Life expectancy and healthy life years in the age of 65 </h3>
              <img class= "zoomimg" src="HLY indicator.svg" alt="Life expectancy and healthy life years chart"> 
              <p>Description: Life expectancy and healthy life years measure the number of remaining years that 
                a person of a certain age is supposed to live without disability. Healthy Life Years introduces 
                the concept of quality of life. It is used to distinguish between years of life free of any activity
                limitation and years experienced with at least one activity limitation. <br>(Eurostat 2017).</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Comparing life expectancy to healthy life years, which is called as HLY indicator, is a one way to measure 
              the quality of life. If expected healthy life years are increasing more rapidly than life expectancy 
              in a population, then not only are people living longer, they are also living a greater portion of 
              their lives free of disability. Life expectancy at the national level is highly correlated to national
              income indicators such as GDP per capita. </p>
    
          <p>As stated, life expectancy in the Nordic countries has increased significantly, and even
              though women generally live longer, the difference between the life expectancy of
              men and of women has been reduced. When comparing population aged 65 and over, the 
            gaps between sexes are still visible. In Finland, Norway and Sweden life expectancy and healthy 
            life years are both slow increasing, but in Denmark healthy life years for both sexes are decreasing.

      <p>When inspecting the causes of death for population aged 65 and over with the change between years 2000 and 2015, 
          a steady, declining trend can be seen in deaths caused by diseases of the circulatory system 
          (including e.g. coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension), neoplasms (tumors, cancer)
            and ischaemic heart diseases between countries. A substantial proportion of these are caused by
          lifestyle risk factors: alcohol, tobacco, unhealthy diet and limited physical exercise.</p>
      <p>However, deaths caused by diseases of the nervous system, mental and behavioural disorders and 
            dementia have become more common almost in every country. In Finland the change has been drastic

      <p>In the previous section the health status of population aged 65 and over was inspected in general,
        but actually it is a diverse group. Health status is dependent on multiple factors, for example lifestyle,
        income or education levels and social factors. </p>
        <p>These all create differences in health status among people aged 65 and over.
        Some get chronic diseases and lose their functionality while others maintain their health for long

  <p> Compared to EU average self-perceived health of population aged 65 and over in Denmark, Finland, Norway

  <p> In Norway the percentages of self-perceived health stay steady as people get older, and almost 60 percent 
    of over 85 year-olds perceive their health very good or good. On the contrary in Finland the percentages 
    get rapidly smaller as people get older and only a bit over 20 percent of people ager over 85 reports

      clearly over 50 % in all age groups, but in Denmark and Finland limitations clearly increase with aging.</p>
      <p>The longer people can remain mobile and care for themselves, the threshold for frailty and disability is
          being pushed later into old age and the lower the costs for health treatment

            <p>The demand for health care goods and services depend on the number of people in need of care. 
                This depends not only on the size of the population, but also on the health status of the population, 
                which is linked to the age structure and notably to the ratio of elderly people in the population.
                The reason for this is that older people often develop multi-morbidity conditions which require medical care.</p> 
                
                <p>One indicator measuring this is the so-called demographic old-age dependency ratio, which relates 
                  the number of individuals that are likely to be “dependent” on the support of others for their 
                  daily living – youths and the elderly – to the number of those individuals who are capable of 
                  providing such support. It is estimated that this will more than double by 2075.

            <p>According to Nordic Council (2018) health differences due to social status are consistent

                    for care.</b> This has a profound impact on the structure of the society itself 
                    and causes a pressing need for rethinking social and health service 
                    structures in the future.  </p>
